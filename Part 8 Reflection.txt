1. The Factory method creates Book objects away from the rest of the system logic so the client code
doesn't need to know the information about the different book types. The system can just get the
factory to make the book object, since it knows all the necessary information. The system is more
flexible since you can easily add different book types without modifying other classes.

2. It reduces coupling since the client code doesn't need to know the different book type subclasses.
Increases maintainability since the book creation logic is focused in one area.
Makes the code more open to extension and closed to modification since you can easily add different
book types and dont need to modify the code in other classes.

3. With smaller systems, this much abstraction can border on unnecessary. Can make it feel a little
confusing. If you have a bunch of different book types, making a factory class for each one will eventually
become too much.
