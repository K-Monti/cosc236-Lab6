Explain the Role of the Singleton Pattern:
The Singleton pattern was chosen to ensure that only one instance of BorrowingService was being used. 
We centralize the system by having all members interact with the single service for borrowing and returning books. 
This allows us to apply the same rules consistently. 

Benefits:
-	Consistency: by having only one BorrowingService we can guarantee the same rules are followed for all borrowing and returning that takes place in the system.
-	Efficiency: By only creating one instance of BorrowingService we can be efficient and not waste memory.
Drawback:
-	Flexibility: the singleton pattern reduces flexibility by making the system harder to scale.

Alternative Design Choices:
A manager class could be created to manage instead and centralize operations. This would support the consistency centralization provides but could be more flexible also.
